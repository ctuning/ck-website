 <p>
 We are developing a common methodology, <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck">framework</a>
 and decentralized marketplace for collaborative and reproducible 
 benchmarking, optimization and co-design
 of efficient software/hardware stack for emerging AI/ML algorithms 
 (inference, object detection, training, etc) 
 requested by <a href="http://cKnowledge.org/request">our industrial advisory board</a>
 in terms of speed, accuracy, energy, size, complexity, costs and other metrics.

 <p>
 We then organize <a href="http://cKnowledge.org/request">open ReQuEST competitions</a> bringing together AI, ML and systems researchers
 to share complete algorithm implementations (code and data) as <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Portable-workflows">portable</a>, 
 customizable and reusable <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki#user-content-reusable-ck-components">Collective Knowledge workflows and components</a>
 with a unified JSON API.

 This helps other researchers and end-users to quickly validate such results, reuse workflows and 
 optimize/autotune algorithms across different platforms, models, data sets, libraries, compilers and tools.

 We also use our practical experience reproducing experimental 
 results from ReQuEST submissions to help set up artifact evaluation 
 at the upcoming <a href="http://sysml.cc">SysML 2019</a>,
 and to suggest new algorithms as customizable CK workflows 
 for the inclusion to the <a href="http://mlperf.org">MLPerf benchmark</a>.

 <p>
 <a href="partners.html">Researchers</a> can then quickly 
 assemble novel AI/ML algorithms from such components as LEGO(tm), extend them, fix bugs,
 and even crowdsource their optimization using devices from IoT to supercomputers
 provided by volunteers or sponsors (see <a href="android-apps.html">Android app</a> and
 <a href="http://cknowledge.org/dnn-crowd-benchmarking-results-tflite">MobileNets crowd-benchmarking results using TFLite framework</a> for example).

 Furthermore, we collect <a href="http://cknowledge.org/repo/web.php?wcid=42b9a1221eb50259:collective_training_set">mispredictions</a> (!)
 from the community to create a realistic and evolving training set which can be used to improve models or even implement self-learning on edge-devices!

 Feel free to try CK yourself on practically any platform with Linux, Windows and MacOS 
 using the following <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/First-Feeling">simple getting started guide</a>.

 <a href="contacts.html">Contact us</a>
 if you would like to join the <a href="http://cKnowledge.org/request">growing CK consortium</a> 
 led by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTuning_foundation">non-profit cTuning foundation</a> 
 and <a href="http://dividiti.com">dividiti Ltd</a> 
 to influence the following community activities:

 <ul>
  <li>Contribute to open AI/ML repositories and share customizable and reusable AI/ML workflows and components with a unified JSON API.</a></li>
  <li>Participate in collaborative testing, optimization, learning and co-design of the efficient AI/SW/HW stack.</a></li>
  <li>Standardize AI/ML APIs and meta descriptions of shared components and workflows.</a></li>
  <li>Substitute ad-hoc AI/ML benchmarks with portable and customizable workflows.</a></li>
  <li>Prepare representative training sets with the help of the community.</a></li>
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
 We hope that our CK approach of portable, customizable, reusable and optimized AI/ML workflows and components
 combined with agile, DevOps and Wikipedia-style development will help to accelerate 
 adoption of AI while dramatically reducing R&D costs and boosting innovation
 as briefly described in this
